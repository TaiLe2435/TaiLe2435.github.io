    towards my Master's in Mechanical Engineering. During my time at NIU, I have participated in the development of autonomous robots in Dr. Ji-Chul Ryu's Autonomous Robotic Manipulation Laboratory.`,
    `From my experiences I have developed skills in robot kinematics/dynamics, control theory, mechatronics, and embedded software development.`,
    `Much of my work has involved the development and implementation of algorithms onto robotic systems. Examples of problems I have worked on deal with 
    state estimation and control, path planning, mechatronic system integration, robotic hardware and software development, automation, and artificial intelligence.`,
